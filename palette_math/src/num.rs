//! Traits for abstracting over numeric types.
//!
//! These traits describe various numeric properties and operations. They are
//! similar in purpose to the immensely helpful traits in
//! [`num-traits`](https://crates.io/crates/num-traits/), but the structure is
//! different. The philosophy behind this module is to focus on capabilities,
//! rather than categories, and to assume as little as possible. Within reason.
//!
//! Instead of having large traits with a lot of methods and dependencies, each
//! operation (or group of operations), are separated into their own traits.
//! This allows number types to have partial compatibility by only implementing
//! some of the traits, and new methods can be added as new traits without
//! affecting old functionality.
