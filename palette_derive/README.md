# palette_derive

Contains derive macros for the [`palette`](https://crates.io/crates/palette/) crate. They are all reexported through `palette` and require it to be a dependency, so there is typically no reason to use this crate directly.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Palette has been automatically tested with Rust version `1.60.0` and the `stable`, `beta`, and `nightly` channels. Future versions of the library may advance the minimum supported version to make use of new language features, but this will normally be considered a breaking change. Exceptions may be made for security patches, dependencies advancing their MSRV in minor or patch releases, and similar changes.
