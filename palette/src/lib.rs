//! A library that makes linear color calculations and conversion easy and
//! accessible for anyone. It uses the type system to enforce correctness and
//! to avoid mistakes, such as mixing incompatible color types.
//!
//! # It's Never "Just RGB"
//!
//! Colors in, for example, images, are often "gamma corrected", or converted
//! using some non-linear transfer function into a format like sRGB before being
//! stored or displayed. This is done as a compression method and to prevent banding,
//! and is also a bit of a legacy from the ages of the CRT monitors, where the
//! output from the electron gun was nonlinear. The problem is that these formats
//! are *non-linear color spaces*, which means that many operations that you may want
//! to perform on colors (addition, subtraction, multiplication, linear interpolation,
//! etc.) will work unexpectedly when performed in such a non-linear color space. As
//! such, the compression has to be reverted to restore linearity and make sure that
//! many operations on the colors are accurate.
//!
//! For example, this does not work:
//!
//! ```rust
//! // An alias for Rgb<Srgb>, which is what most pictures store.
//! use palette::Srgb;
//!
//! let orangeish = Srgb::new(1.0, 0.6, 0.0);
//! let blueish = Srgb::new(0.0, 0.2, 1.0);
//! // let whateve_it_becomes = orangeish + blueish;
//! ```
//!
//! Instead, they have to be made linear before adding:
//!
//! ```rust
//! // An alias for Rgb<Srgb>, which is what most pictures store.
//! use palette::{Pixel, Srgb};
//!
//! let orangeish = Srgb::new(1.0, 0.6, 0.0).into_linear();
//! let blueish = Srgb::new(0.0, 0.2, 1.0).into_linear();
//! let whateve_it_becomes = orangeish + blueish;
//!
//! // Encode the result back into sRGB and create a byte array
//! let pixel: [u8; 3] = Srgb::from_linear(whateve_it_becomes)
//!     .into_format()
//!     .into_raw();
//! ```
//!
//! But, even when colors *are* 'linear', there is yet more to explore.
//!
//! The most common way that colors are defined, especially for computer
//! storage, is in terms of so-called *tristimulus values*, meaning that
//! all colors are defined as a vector of three values which may represent
//! any color. The reason colors can generally be stored as only a three
//! dimensional vector, and not an *n* dimensional one, where *n* is some
//! number of possible frequencies of light, is because our eyes contain
//! only three types of cones. Each of these cones have different sensitivity
//! curves to different wavelengths of light, giving us three "dimensions"
//! of sensitivity to color. These cones are often called the S, M, and L
//! (for small, medium, and large) cones, and their sensitivity curves
//! *roughly* position them as most sensitive to "red", "green", and "blue"
//! parts of the spectrum. As such, we can choose only three values to
//! represent any possible color that a human is able to see. An interesting
//! consequence of this is that humans can see two different objects which
//! are emitting *completely different actual light spectra* as the *exact
//! same perceptual color* so long as those wavelengths, when transformed
//! by the sensitivity curves of our cones, end up resulting in the same
//! S, M, and L values sent to our brains.
//!
//! A **color space** (which simply refers to a set of standards by which
//! we map a set of arbitrary values to real-world colors) which uses
//! tristimulus values is often defined in terms of
//!
//! 1. Its **primaries**
//! 2. Its **reference white** or **white point**
//!
//! The **primaries** together represent the total *gamut* (i.e. displayable
//! range of colors) of that color space, while the **white point** defines
//! which concrete tristimulus value corresponds to a real, physical white
//! reflecting object being lit by a known light source and observed by the
//! 'standard observer' (i.e. a standardized model of human color perception).
//!
//! The informal "RGB" color space is such a tristimulus color space, since
//! it is defined by three values, but it is underspecified since we don't
//! know which primaries are being used (i.e. how exactly are the canonical
//! "red", "green", and "blue" defined?), nor its white point. In most cases,
//! when people talk about "RGB" or "Linear RGB" colors, what they are
//! *actually* talking about is the "Linear sRGB" color space, which uses the
//! primaries and white point defined in the sRGB standard, but which *does
//! not* have the (non-linear) sRGB *transfer function* applied.
//!
//! This library takes these things into account, and attempts to provide an
//! interface which will let those who don't care so much about the intricacies
//! of color still use colors correctly, while also allowing the advanced user
//! a high degree of flexibility in how they use it.
//!
//! # Transparency
//!
//! There are many cases where pixel transparency is important, but there are
//! also many cases where it becomes a dead weight, if it's always stored
//! together with the color, but not used. Palette has therefore adopted a
//! structure where the transparency component (alpha) is attachable using the
//! [`Alpha`](crate::Alpha) type, instead of having copies of each color
//! space.
//!
//! This approach comes with the extra benefit of allowing operations to
//! selectively affect the alpha component:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use palette::{LinSrgb, LinSrgba};
//!
//! let mut c1 = LinSrgba::new(1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.8);
//! let c2 = LinSrgb::new(0.5, 1.0, 1.0);
//!
//! c1.color = c1.color * c2; //Leave the alpha as it is
//! c1.blue += 0.2; //The color components can easily be accessed
//! c1 = c1 * 0.5; //Scale both the color and the alpha
//! ```
//!
//! # A Basic Workflow
//!
//! The overall workflow can be divided into three steps, where the first and
//! last may be taken care of by other parts of the application:
//!
//! ```text
//! Decoding -> Processing -> Encoding
//! ```
//!
//! ## 1. Decoding
//!
//! Find out what the source format is and convert it to a linear color space.
//! There may be a specification, such as when working with SVG or CSS.
//!
//! When working with RGB or gray scale (luma):
//!
//! * If you are asking your user to enter an RGB value, you are in a gray zone
//! where it depends on the context. It's usually safe to assume sRGB, but
//! sometimes it's already linear.
//!
//! * If you are decoding an image, there may be some meta data that gives you
//! the necessary details. Otherwise it's most commonly sRGB. Usually you
//! will end up with a slice or vector with RGB bytes, which can easily be
//! converted to Palette colors:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # let mut image_buffer: Vec<u8> = vec![];
//! use palette::{Srgb, Pixel};
//!
//! // This works for any (even non-RGB) color type that can have the
//! // buffer element type as component.
//! let color_buffer: &mut [Srgb<u8>] = Pixel::from_raw_slice_mut(&mut image_buffer);
//! ```
//!
//! * If you are getting your colors from the GPU, in a game or other graphical
//! application, or if they are otherwise generated by the application, then
//! chances are that they are already linear. Still, make sure to check that
//! they are not being encoded somewhere.
//!
//! When working with other colors:
//!
//! * For HSL, HSV, HWB: Check if they are based on any other color space than
//! sRGB, such as Adobe or Apple RGB.
//!
//! * For any of the CIE color spaces, check for a specification of white point
//! and light source. These are necessary for converting to RGB and other
//! colors, that depend on perception and "viewing devices". Common defaults
//! are the D65 light source and the sRGB white point. The Palette defaults
//! should take you far.
//!
//! ## 2. Processing
//!
//! When your color has been decoded into some Palette type, it's ready for
//! processing. This includes things like blending, hue shifting, darkening and
//! conversion to other formats. Just make sure that your non-linear RGB is
//! made linear first (`my_srgb.into_linear()`), to make the operations
//! available.
//!
//! Different color spaced have different capabilities, pros and cons. You may
//! have to experiment a bit (or look at the example programs) to find out what
//! gives the desired result.
//!
//! ## 3. Encoding
//!
//! When the desired processing is done, it's time to encode the colors back
//! into some image format. The same rules applies as for the decoding, but the
//! process reversed.
//!
//! # Working with Raw Data
//!
//! Oftentimes, pixel data is stored in a raw buffer such as a `[u8; 3]`. The
//! [`Pixel`](crate::encoding::pixel::Pixel) trait allows for easy interoperation between
//! Palette colors and other crates or systems. `from_raw` can be used to
//! convert into a Palette color, `into_format` converts from  `Srgb<u8>` to
//! `Srgb<f32>`, and finally `into_raw` to convert from a Palette color back to
//! a `[u8;3]`.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use approx::assert_relative_eq;
//! use palette::{Srgb, Pixel};
//!
//! let buffer = [255, 0, 255];
//! let raw = Srgb::from_raw(&buffer);
//! assert_eq!(raw, &Srgb::<u8>::new(255u8, 0, 255));
//!
//! let raw_float: Srgb<f32> = raw.into_format();
//! assert_relative_eq!(raw_float, Srgb::new(1.0, 0.0, 1.0));
//!
//! let raw: [u8; 3] = Srgb::into_raw(raw_float.into_format());
//! assert_eq!(raw, buffer);
//! ```
